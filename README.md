# agentic-sdlc

A gate-enforced SDLC pipeline for AI coding agents. Ticket in, reviewed PR out — with an independent AI judge at every artifact boundary before you ship.

> *Review early, review often.* A flaw surfaced before coding costs nothing. The same flaw after five tasks can invalidate all five.

Works with Claude Code, OpenCode, Cursor, and GitHub Copilot.

## Installation

**One-liner (recommended):**

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mhihasan/agentic-sdlc/main/install.sh | bash
```

Installs for all tools (Claude Code, Copilot) at user scope. Skills land in `~/.claude/skills/` and `~/.copilot/skills/`. Re-run the same command to update.

**Options:**

```bash
# Claude only
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mhihasan/agentic-sdlc/main/install.sh | bash -s -- --tool=claude

# Copilot only
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mhihasan/agentic-sdlc/main/install.sh | bash -s -- --tool=copilot

# Project-scoped
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mhihasan/agentic-sdlc/main/install.sh | bash -s -- --scope=project --tool=claude /path/to/your-project
```

**Local clone (if you prefer):**

```bash
git clone git@github.com:mhihasan/agentic-sdlc.git
cd agentic-sdlc

./install.sh --scope=user --tool=claude     # → ~/.claude/skills/   (Claude Code, OpenCode, Cursor)
./install.sh --scope=user --tool=copilot    # → ~/.copilot/skills/  (GitHub Copilot)
./install.sh --scope=user --tool=all        # → both
```

Safe to re-run: existing symlinks are updated, real directories are never overwritten.

## Quickstart

**Full pipeline from a Jira ticket:**

```
/picking-up-task https://yoursite.atlassian.net/browse/PROJ-123
```

Each skill tells you what to run next. Full sequence:

```
/picking-up-task → /planning-from-spec → /generating-tasks → /reviewing-plan → /implementing-tasks → /reviewing-code → /crafting-commits
```

Enter at any step if the upstream artifact already exists.

---

**Review any branch right now:**

```
/reviewing-code
```

Reviews your staged diff by default, or pass `branch`, a PR number, or a diff file. Dispatches parallel AI judges, filters the diff by domain, produces a triage-first report. No plan file needed.

## Design Principles

**Two review tiers, split by role.** Self-review handles mechanical checks: cheap, always runs, catches placeholders and format issues. AI-as-judge handles subjective quality calls: fresh context, targeted, catches design and scope problems.

| Tier | Who | Scope | When |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Self-review** | The producing skill checks its own output | Objective, mechanical checks only (placeholders, file coverage, format) | Every artifact boundary; runs in both modes |
| **AI-as-judge** | Independent fresh-context subagent | Subjective quality calls (scope, over-engineering, breaking changes, design) with BLOCKER/SHOULD-FIX/NIT severity | [`/reviewing-plan`](skills/reviewing-plan/SKILL.md) (before code) · [`/reviewing-code`](skills/reviewing-code/SKILL.md) (after code) |

**Human gates are not optional.** Every AI verdict requires your approval before the next step starts. `REVIEW-LOG.md` is the audit trail.

**No self-preference bias.** Judge subagents run in a fresh context with no access to the producing session's framing or justifications.

**Auto mode removes pauses, not safeguards.** Git boundaries and judge halts hold in both modes.

## Collaborative vs auto mode

Every pipeline skill accepts an optional `auto` argument. **Collaborative is the default.**

| | Collaborative | Auto |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Forward-progress pauses | Pause for human | Proceed on own judgment |
| Git writes (commit / push / merge / PR) | Human-initiated | **Never self-initiated** |
| Judge halt (DO NOT PROCEED / FAIL verdict) | Halt | **Halt** |
| Unresolvable ambiguity | Ask | **Ask** |

`auto` does not chain skills. Even in auto mode, each skill is a discrete command.
