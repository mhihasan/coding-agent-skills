# agent-skills

Generic engineering craft skills for AI coding assistants.

Book-grounded, employer-neutral, and reusable by any engineer. Works with
Claude Code, OpenCode, Cursor, and any tool that reads `~/.claude/skills/`.

## Installation

```bash
git clone git@github.com:mhihasan/agent-skills.git ~/repos/agentic-skills
cd ~/repos/agentic-skills
./install.sh
```

`install.sh` symlinks all skills into `~/.claude/skills/` (and any other
agent tool directories detected on your machine). Safe to re-run — existing
symlinks are updated, real directories are never overwritten.
